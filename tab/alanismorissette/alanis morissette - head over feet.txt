 I thought about it
 
C    G        Am   F              C    G        Am  F
 You treat me like I'm a princess, I'm not used to liking that
C    G          Am      F
 You ask how my day was
 
               D       Bm  G           A
You've already won me over in spite of me
          D           Bm   Bb        A
Don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
                D           Bm           G            A

F          C        G
I couldn't help it, it's all your fault
 
C     G       Am    F                         C       G       Am     F
 Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole, you're so much braver than I gave you credit for
C       G       Am      F
 That's not lip service
 
               D       Bm  G           A
You've already won me over in spite of me

C    G       Am        F                    C    G         Am     F
 You are the bearer of unconditional things, you held your breath and the door for me
C       G        Am       F
 Thanks for your patience

 You're the best listener that I've ever met, you're my best friend, best friend with benefits
C     G       Am      F
 What took me so long
 
C     G     Am        F              C     G     Am     F
 I've never felt this healthy before, I've never wanted something rational
C  G   Am      F   C   G   Am      F
 I am aware now....  I am aware now

               D       Bm  G           A
