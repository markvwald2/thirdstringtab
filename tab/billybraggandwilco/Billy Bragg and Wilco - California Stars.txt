            G                               D
I'd like to rest my heavy head tonight on a bed of California stars
            C                               G
I'd like to lay my weary bones tonight on a bed of California stars
            G                                        D
I'd love to feel your hand touching mine and tell me why I must keep working on
         C                                        G
Yes, I'd give my life to lay my head tonight on a bed of California stars

            G                               D
I'd like to dream my troubles all away on a bed of California stars
C                                                 G
Jump up from my starbed and make another day underneath my California stars

          G                                            D
They hang like grapes on vines that shine and warm the lovers glass like friendly wine

        C                                                 G
So, I'd give this world just to dream a dream with you on our bed of California stars
