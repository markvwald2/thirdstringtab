intro
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2 x2

Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
There's rows and rows of house,
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
with windows painted blue
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
With the light from the t.v
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
running parallel to you

Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
But there is no sunken treasure,
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
rumored to be
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
Wrapped inside my ribs
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
in a sea black with ink

     A5         Bmadd4/D  G5   F#5   E5
I am so out of tune with you,
                Bmadd4/D   G5
I am so our of tune with you

Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2 x2

Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
If I had a mountain,
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
I'd try to fold it over
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
If I had a boat,
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
you know I'd probably roll over
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
And I leave it on the shore,
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
I'd leave it for somebody
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
Surely there's somebody
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
who needs it more than me

     A5         Bmadd4/D  G5   F#5   E5
I am so out of tune with you,
                Bmadd4/D   G5
I am so our of tune with you

F5   E5   A#aug6/G   D#5 x6

Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
All the leaves will burn
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
and autumn fires then return
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
All the fires we burn,
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
all will return
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
Music is my savior,
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
and I was maimed by rock and roll
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
I was maimed by rock and roll
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
I was tamed by rock and roll
Dsus2   D6sus2   Dmaj9   G6sus2
I got my name from rock and roll

Dsus2   G/D x2
