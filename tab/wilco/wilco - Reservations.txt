intro (for piano)
C   Am   Em   F   G   C   G

C
How can I convince you it's me I don't like, and
Am                            Em
Not be so indifferent to the look in your eyes
          F
When I've always been distant
                      G        C   G
And I've always told lies for love

     C
I'm bound by these choices so hard to make
     Am                     Em
I'm bound by the feeling so easy to fake
F                               G            C   G
None of this is real enough to take me from you

C              Em
I've got reservations
      Am        Em         Dm       B5/F
About so many things, but not about you

C   Am   Em   F   G   C   G

   C
I know this isn't what you were wanting me to say
Am                           Em
How can I get closer and be further away
           F                           G      C   G
From the truth that proves it's beautiful to lie

C              Em
I've got reservations
      Am        Em         Dm       B5/F
About so many things, but not about you

C              Em
I've got reservations
      Am        Em         Dm       B5/F
About so many things, but not about you

           F              Em             Dm             C
Not about you, not about you, not about you, not about you

Am   Em   F   G   C
