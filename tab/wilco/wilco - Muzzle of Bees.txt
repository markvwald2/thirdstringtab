intro
riff 1 x2

           A
There's a random painted highway
G               riff 1
And a muzzle of bees
A
My sleeves have come unstitched
       G            riff 1
From climbing your tree

riff 1

     G
And dogs laugh, some say they're barking
                       riff 1
I don't think they're mean
G
Some people get so frightened
                    riff 1
Of the fences in between

        A
And the sun gets passed from tree to tree
Em             G      riff 1
Silently, and back to me
           A
With the breeze blown through
A                      Em
Pushed up against the sea
G               riff 2 x2
Finally back to me

     G
I'm assuming you got my message
           riff 2 x2
On your machine
       G
I'm assuming you love me
                        riff 2 x2
And you know what that means

Amadd2   Cmaj7   G   riff 1

Amadd2   Cmaj7   G   D

A
Sun gets passed, sea to sea
Em             G       D
Silently, and back to me
A
With the breeze blown through
A                       Em
Pushed up above the leaves
A
With the breeze blown through
A                   Em
My head upon your knee
             G            D
Half of it's you, half is me
Em                G       D
Half of it's you, half is me

Amadd2   Cmaj7   G   D x6
