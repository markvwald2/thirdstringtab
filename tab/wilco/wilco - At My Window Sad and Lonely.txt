intro
G   C   G  x4

       G       C       G      C
At my window, sad and lonely
Em               C        G   C
Oft times do I think of thee
       G       C       G      C
Sad and lonely and I wonder
Em               C        G   C
Do you ever think of me

G      Em             G
Every day is sad and lonely
Em                           G   C
And every night is sad and blue
G                                  Em
Do you ever think of me my darling
        C                G   C   G   C
As you sail that ocean blue

       G       C       G      C
At my window, sad and lonely
Em                  C        G   C
I stand and look across the sea
G              C      G      C
And I sad and lonely wonder
Em            C       G   C
Do you ever think of me

G         Em            G
Will you find another sweetheart
Em                       G   C
In some far and distant land
G                            Em
Sad and lonely now I wonder
        C              G   C
If our boat will ever land

G   C  x2

G           Em           G
Ships may ply the stormy ocean
Em                              G   C
And planes may fly the stormy sky
G                                Em
I'm sad and lonely but remember
         C               G   C
Oh I'll love you till I die

Em   C   G
