A
All I can see is black and white and white and pink with blades of blue
That lay between the words I think on a page I was meaning to send
D
You I couldn't tell not to bring my heart the way wanted when I started
A
Writing this letter to you
E
And if I could you know I would just hold your hand you'd understand
D               A
I'm the man who loves you

A
All I can be is a busy sea with spinning wheels and hands that feel
For stones to throw and feet that run but I come back home, makes no difference
D                               A
Makes no difference ever known, makes no difference ever known to me
E
And if I could you know I would just hold your hand you'd understand
D               A
I'm the man who loves you

A
All I can see is black and white and white and pink with blades of blue

D
You I couldn't tell not to bring my heart the way wanted when I started
A
Writing this letter to you
E
And if I could you know I would just hold your hand you'd understand
Bm
If I could you know I would just hold your hand you'd understand
D
If I could you know I would just hold your hand you'd understand

                Bm         D
I'm the man who loves you
                Bm         D
I'm the man who loves you
                Bm         D
I'm the man who loves you
                A
I'm the man who loves you
