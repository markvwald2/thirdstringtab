A                          G              A
Tires type black where the blacktop cracks
A                         G      F          A
Weeds spark through, dark green enough to be blue

A                                       G        F#m         Em
When the mysteries we believe in aren't dreamed enough to be true
     Dm               G         D              A
Some side with the leaves, some side with the seeds

A                     G       A
The treetops nod, the rain applauds
A                            G          F     A
The park grows dark, and the swings all slowly die
     A                               G      F#m  Em
But you and I will be undefeated by agreeing to disagree
        Dm            G             D            A
No one wins but the thieves, so why side with anything

A   G   F#m   Em   Dm   G   D   A   G   A

A                      G              A
The streetlights' glow comes and goes
A                           G          F       A
When the sun comes back, as we all can plainly see
A                              G    F#m          Em
Embracing the situation is our only chance to be free
      Dm        G                   D
I'll side with you if you side with me
