intro
F   Em   Am   Dm/A   C/G

C/G             F                    C/G           G
I will throw myself underneath the wheels of any train of thought
C/G                         F                          C/G            G
Running off the rails I'll sail you through the rogue waves of your brain
C/G                 F               C/G              G
If I could bring a light to shine upon the dark and disobeying
C/G                F                     C/G          G
Night so young but I still say we're too old for cliches

   F                         Em                  Am       Am7/G   D7
Oh I can only dream of the dreams we'd share if you were so inclined
C/G      G       F            Am   Dm/A     C/G
I would love to be the one to open up your mind

C/G               F               C/G                       G
I could base my whole existence upon the cherry-strands of your gold hair
C/G             F                 C/G                  G
I would ask, almost insist upon treating you kind and fair

   F                         Em                     Am           Am7/G   D7
Oh I can only dream of the dreams we'd have if our hearts would be entwined
C/G           G      F            Am   Dm/A     C/G
If you would let me be the one to open up your mind

F   Em   Am   Dm/A   C/G

C/G             F                C/G                G
I'd still be myself beneath the banks all broken beside the stream
C/G                    F                       C/G         G
ready to return your thoughts unlearned so it goes, so it seems

   F                         Em                  Am          Am7/G   D7
Oh I can only dream of the dreams we'd share if you weren't so defined
C/G      G       F            Am   Dm/A     C/G
I would love to be the one to open up your mind
F                    Em           Am   Dm/A     C/G
If you would let me be the one to open up your mind

F  Em   Am   Dm/A   C/G
