And when I           asked for a separate       room
       C    Dadd4  A11  G                   C             Dadd4  A11  G
it was late at          night and we'd been driving since noon

    C  Dadd4  A11  G                    C     Dadd4  A11  G
But if I'd         known how that would sound to          you
             C      Dadd4  A11  G           C          Dadd4   A11     G
I would have stayed in     your bed for the rest of my life    just to prove I was right

          C         Dadd4      A11  G              C             Dadd4  A11 G
That it's harder to be friends than lovers and you shouldn't try to mix the two
             C         Dadd4        A11  G               C             Dadd4   A11   G
Cause if you do it and you're still un   happy, then you know that the problem is    you

         C           Dadd4      A11    G         C              Dadd4  A11 G
And it's true that I stole your lighter and it's also true that I lost the map
             C           Dadd4  A11   G             C                Dadd4   A11   G
But when you said that I wasn't worth talking to, I had to take your word    on    that

    C  Dadd4  A11  G                    C  Dadd4  A11  G
But if you'd       known how that would sound     to   me
               C Dadd4  A11  G
You would have taken    it   back

    F               C      G  Gb     G     Gb G
And boxed it up and buried it in the ground
    F               C      G  Gb     G     Gb G
And boxed it up and buried it in the ground
    F               C      G  Gb     G     Gb G
And boxed it up and buried it in the ground
F                C      G   Gb G Gb G
Burned it up and thrown it away

C       Dadd4  A11  G                    C  Dadd4  A11  G
You put in     my   hands a loaded gun and then you told me not to fire it
When you did the things you said were up to me
And then accused me of trying to fuck it up

F                C    G  Gb    G     Gb   G
But you've never been no waste of my time
F          C    G Gb  G Gb G
It's never been a drag
F              C      G   Gb    G    Gb       G
So take a deep breath and count back from ten
    F            C  G Gb   G Gb G
And maybe you'll be alright

[main riff]
And the license said
You had to stick around until I was dead
But if you're tired of looking at my face
I guess I already am

F                C    G  Gb    G     Gb   G
But you've never been no waste of my time
F          C    G Gb  G Gb G
It's never been a drag
F              C      G   Gb    G    Gb       G
So take a deep breath and count back from ten
    F            C  G Gb   G Gb G
And maybe you'll be alright
