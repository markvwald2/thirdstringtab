Love of two is one

Here but now they're gone

Came the last night of sadness
           F         E7           Am
And it was clear she couldn't go on
         F                     G      Am   G
Then the door was open and the wind appeared
    F       G         Am           G
The candles blew then disappeared
    F        G         Am          G      F   
The curtains flew then he appeared...saying don't be afraid
 
G       Am             G      F
Come on baby...and she had no fear
        G      Am              G          F
And she ran to him...then they started to fly
            G            Am                    G           F
They looked backward and said goodby...she had become like they are
        G         Am             G           F
She had taken his hand...she had become like they are
G       Am           G        F
Come on baby...don't fear the reaper . . .
