Am  Dm  G  C  F  B E

Am                           Dm
At first I was afraid, I was petrified
                G                              C
I kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
           F                                  B
But then I spent so many nights just thinking how you've done me wrong
           E
and I grew strong, I learned how to get along

    Am                        Dm
And so you're back from outer space
              G                                C
I just walked in to find you here without that look upon your face
              F                                      B
I should have changed my fucking locks, I would have made you leave your key
            E
if I'd have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me

   Am                   Dm               G                     C
Oh now go, walk out the door, just turn around now, you're not welcome anymore
F                                B
weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire?
                  E
did you think I'd crumble? did you think I'd lay down and die?

       Am           Dm            G                             C
Oh not I, I will survive, yeah as long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive
         F                             B
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
          E
I will survive, I will survive, yeah, yeah

Am  Dm  G  C  F  B E  2x

        Am                                 Dm
It took all the strength I had just not to fall apart
           G                             C
I'm tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
      F                                    B
and I spent oh so many nights just feelin' sorry for myself
          E
I used to cry, but now I hold my head up high

    Am                Dm
And you'll see me with somebody new
             G                             C
I'm not that stupid little person still in love with you
           F                                    B
and so you thought you'd just drop by and you expect me to be free
            E
but now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me

       Am                Dm                  G                     C
Oh now go, walk out the door, Just turn around now, you're not welcome anymore
F                                B
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire?
                  E
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

   Am                   Dm               G                     C
Oh now go, walk out the door, just turn around now, you're not welcome anymore
F                                B
Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire?
                  E
Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die?

       Am           Dm            G                             C
Oh not I, I will survive, yeah as long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive
         F                             B
I've got all my life to live, I've got all my love to give
          E
I will survive, I will survive, yeah, yeah

Am  Dm  G  C  F  B E  2x
Am
