Poor old Granddad, I laughed at all his words
  D                               Em7
I thought he was a bitter man, he spoke of women's ways
        D                            Em7
They'll trap you then they use you before you even know

For love is blind and you're far too kind, don't ever let it show

  D                            Em7
I wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger
  D                            Em7
I wish that I knew what I know now when I was stronger

    D                                     Em7
The Can Can's such a pretty show, they'll steal your heart away

But backstage, back on earth again, the dressing rooms are grey
     D                                               Em7
They come on strong and it ain't too long 'fore they make you feel a man
    D                                            Em7

When you want her lips, you get a cheek, makes you wonder where you are
       D                                                Em7
If you want some more and she's fast asleep, leaves you twinkling with the stars
D                            Em7
Poor young grandson, there's nothing I can say
       D                              Em7
You'll have to learn just like me and that's the hardest way
       D          Em7
Ooh la la, ooh la la la la yeah
