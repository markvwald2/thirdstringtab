        C          G                        D           G
And the sign said "Long-haired freaky people need not apply"
   D                   A                   G                  A
So I tucked my hair up under my hat, and I went in to ask him why
Bm                                              G
He said "You look like a fine, upstanding young man, I think you do"
     D                          A                 G              A
So I took off my hat and said "Imagine that! Heh, me workin' for you!"

      D         C            G     D                         G
Whoa, sign sign everywhere a sign, blockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind
D                 A                        C        D
Do this, don't do that, can't you read the sign?

        C                 G                 D                 G
And the sign said anybody caught trespassin' would be shot on sight
     D                         A                        G                   A
So I jumped on the fence and I yelled at the house "Hey, what gives you the right?
   Bm                                  G
To put up a fence to keep me out or to keep Mother Nature in
   D                 A                       G                       A
If God was here he'd tell you to your face, "Man you're some kind of sinner!"

      D         C            G     D                         G
Whoa, sign sign everywhere a sign, blockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind
D                 A                        C        D
Do this, don't do that, can't you read the sign?

    A                                   G                      D
Now hey there mister can't you read? You gotta have a shirt and tie to get a seat
D                        A              G                     D
You can't even watch, no you can't eat, you ain't supposed to be here
C             G                        D             G
Sign said you got to have a membership card to get inside... Uhhh

D  C  G  D  G
D  A  G  D

        C          G                       D                  G
And the sign said "Everybody welcome, come in, kneel down and pray"
              D                              A                G                      A
But when they passed around the plate at the end of it all, I didn't have a penny to pay
     Bm                              G
So I got me a pen and a paper, and I made up my own little sign
        D                  A                       G              A
I said "Thank you Lord for thinkin' about me, I'm alive and doin' fine!"

      D         C            G     D                         G
Whoa, sign sign everywhere a sign, blockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind
D                 A                        C       D
Do this, don't do that, can't you read the sign?

      D         C            G     D                         G
Whoa, sign sign everywhere a sign, blockin' out the scenery, breakin' my mind
D                 A                        C
