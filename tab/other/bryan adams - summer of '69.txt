  I got my first real six-string, bought it at a five-and-dime
D                                A
  Played it 'til my fingers bled, it was the summer of 69

D                             A
  Me and some guys from school had a band and we tried real hard
D                                 A
  Jimmy quit and Jody got married, I shoulda known we'd never get far

Bm        A
Oh when I look back now
D                     G
that summer seemed to last forever
Bm          A
Oh and if I had a choice
D               G
Yeah I'd always wanna be there
Bm             A               D    A
Those were the best days of my life

D                          A
Ain't no use in complainin' when you got a job to do
D                                     A
Spent my evenings down at the drive-in and that's where I met you

Bm              A
Standin on your mama's porch
D                      G
You told me that you'd wait forever
Bm              A
Oh and when you held my hand
D                  G
I knew that it was now or never
Bm             A               D    A
Those were the best days of my life
                       D   A
Back in the summer of '69

F           Bb
Man we were killing time
        C                      D
we were young and restless, we needed to unwind
F       Bb                  C
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no

D  A  D  A

D                             A
And now the times are changing look at everything thats come and gone
D                                        A
Sometimes when I play that old six-string I think about you wonder what went wrong

Bm               A
Standin' on your mama's porch
D                    G
You told me it would last forever
Bm             A
Oh the way you held my hand
D                  G
I knew that it was now or never
Bm             A               D    A
Those were the best days of my life
                        D  A
Back in the summer of '69
                        D  A
Back in the summer of '69
