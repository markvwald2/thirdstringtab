I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
 D              Dsus4     C       G/B   G
Turned on some music to start my day
   D      Dsus4       C         G/B   G
I lost myself in a familiar song
    D       Dsus4        C          G/B  Am   G   D
I closed my eyes and I slipped away

I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)

When I m tired and thinking cold

And dream of a girl, I used to know
