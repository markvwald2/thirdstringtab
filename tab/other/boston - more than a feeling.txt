I looked out this morning and the sun was gone
D              Dsus4    C        G 
Turned on some music to start my day
  D      Dsus4     C        G
I lost myself in a familiar song
  D         Dsus4      Am       Dsus4 D
I closed my eyes and I slipped away

It s more than a feeling, more than a feeling
       G             C     Em           D
when I hear that old song, they used to play (more than a feeling)
G       C         Em          D
I begin dreaming (more than a feeling)
       G       C          Eb
till I see Marianne walk away
Em       A        Asus4   A
I see my Marianne walkin away

So many people have come and gone
      D     Dsus4       C        G
Their faces fade as the years go by
D     Dsus4           C        G
Yet I still recall as I wander on
   D            Dsus4      Am     Dsus4 D
As clear as the sun in the summer sky

When I m tired and thinking cold
  D          Dsus4     C       G
I hide in my music, forget the day
    D          Dsus4   C       G
And dream of a girl, I used to know
  D         Dsus4        Am       D
I closed my eyes and she slipped away
    Am       Dsus4 D
she slipped away.
