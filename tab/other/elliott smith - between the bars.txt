Am7            F                          C                        E7
Drink up baby, stay up all night with the things you could do, you won't but you might
      Am7                    F                     C        E7          F
The potential you'll be that you'll never see, the promises you'll only make
      Am7                   F                 C                 E7
Drink up with me now and forget all about the pressure of days, do what I say
         Am7               F                    C      E7            F
And I'll make you okay and drive them away, the images stuck in your head

F  G   riff 1                      F     G     Am       Am/F#
People you've been before that you don't want around anymore
     F        G               riff 1             F              Fm
That push and shove and won't bend to your will, I'll keep them still

Am7            F                       C              E7
Drink up baby, look at the stars, I'll kiss you again between the bars
          Am7                        F                 C          E7         F
Where I'm seeing you there with your hands in the air, waiting to finally be caught
      Am7                  F                   C               E7
Drink up one more time and I'll make you mine, keep you apart, keep in my heart
    Am7                        F                     C        E7            F
Separate from the rest where I like you the best and keep the things you forgot

F  G   riff 1                      F     G     Am       Am/F#
People you've been before that you don't want around anymore
     F        G               riff 1             F              Fm
That push and shove and won't bend to your will, I'll keep them still
