G       Em     Am  C/G   D
Was an honest man,       asked me for the phone, tried to take control
    C                        Am7                       G
Oh, I don't see it that way, I don't see it that way
 
G          Em     Am  C/G  D
We shared some ideas,      all obsessed with fame, says we're all the same
    C                        Am7                      Am7
Oh, I don't see it that way, I don't see it that way

G              Em  B5              A5
Raised in Carolina, I'm not like that
G            Em      B5           A5
Tryin' to remind her, when we go back

   G                                                 B5                   A5
I missed the last bus, I'll take the next train, I try but you see, it's hard to explain
   G                                               B5                     A5
I said the right things, but act the wrong way, I like it right here, but I cannot stay
   G                                         B5                   A5
I watched the TV, forget what I'm told, well I am too young and they are too old
     G                                           B5 (x3)   (break)
The joke is on you, this place is a zoo, you're right, it's true

He said he can't decide,      I shake my head to say everything's just great
    C                      Am7                     Am7
Oh, I just can't remember, I just can't remember

Raised in Carolina, (she says) I'm not like that
G            Em      B5           A5
Tryin' to remind her, when we go back

I'll make it you see, I'm ever so pleased, pretend to be nice so I can be mean
