G  D  Am  Em

            G  D         Am                      Em
Many years ago he looked out through a glassless window
                  G       D   Am
All that he could see was Babylon
                G          D          Am                   Em
Beautiful green fields and dreams and learn to measure the stars
                G     D      Am
But there was a worry in his heart, he said

Am               D       Am
   "How could it come to this?
                       D        Am
I'm really worried about living
             D       Am
How could it come to this?
                        D         C
Yeah, I really want to know about this"
             G     D    Am
Is it like today? Ohh ohoh

                  G       D     Am                    Em
Then there came a day it moved out 'cross the Mediterranean
                G             D           Am
Came to western isles and the Greek young men
                 G            D              Am             Em
With their silver beards they laughed at the unknown of the universe
                G       D           Am
They could just sit and guess god's name, but they said

Am               D       Am
   "How could it come to this?
                         D        Am
We're really worried about living
             D       Am
How could it come to this?
                         D         C
Yeah, we really want to know about this"
             G     D    Am
Is it like today? Ohh ohoh

                    G       D       Am             Em
Then there followed days of Kings, Empires and revolution
                      G            D        Am
Blood just looks the same when you open the vein
                 G      D        Am            Em
Sometimes it was faith, power or reason as the cornerstone
                 G        D              Am
But the furrowed brow has never left his face, he says

Am               D       Am
   "How could it come to this?
                       D     Am
We've been living in a landslide
             D       Am
How could it come to this?
                         D         C
Yeah, we really want to know about this"

            G     D    Am
Is it like today? Ohh ohoh

                  G     D          Am                     Em
Then there came a day, man packed up, moved off from the planet
              G      D      Am
He went to the moon, to the moon
                G      D    Am             Em
Now he's out in space, hey, fixing all the problems
                 G    D    Am
He comes face to face with God, he says

Am               D       Am
   "How could it come to this?
                            D    Am
I'm really worried about my creation
           D       Am
How did it come to this?
                       D       C
You're really killing me you know

                G   D    Am
It isn't just a day Ohh ohoh
             G    D   Am
Is it like a day? Hey Oh
             G     D     Am
Is it like today? Oh   Bang!

             G  D        Am                      Em
Many years ago he looked out through a glassless window
            G      D            Am
Didn't understand much what he saw.
