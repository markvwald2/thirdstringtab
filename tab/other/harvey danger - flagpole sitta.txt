D                                                  Am
I had visions I was in them I was looking into the mirror
                    C                                  D
To see a little bit clearer, the rottenness and evil in me
D                                                             Am
Fingertips have memories mine can't forget the curves of your body
                       C                                    D
And when I feel a bit naughty, I run it up the flagpole and see
 
Who salutes, but no one ever does
  
D                        Em               C                   D
I'm not sick but I'm not well, and I'm so hot, cause I'm in hell

D                                                           Am
Been around the world and found that only stupid people are breeding
                        C                               D
The cretins cloning and feeding, and I don't even own a tv
D                                                      Am
Put me in the hospital for nerves and then they had to commit me
                        C                             D
You told them all I was crazy, they cut off my legs now I'm an amputee god damn you
 
D                        Em               C                 D
I'm not sick but I'm not well, and I'm so hot, cause I'm in hell
D                        Em              C                D
I'm not sick but I'm not well, and it's a sin, to live so well

I wanna publish 'zines, and rage against machines
        G                                      A
I wanna pierce my tongue, it doesn't hurt, it feels fine
            G                             F
The trivial sublime, I'd like to turn off time
            G                 D
and kill my mind, you kill my mind
  
D                                             Am
Paranoia, paranoia, everybody's comin' to get me
                       C                                  D
Just say you never met me, I'm going underground with the moles 
 
to get holes
D                                                                Am
Hear the voices in my head I swear to god it sounds like they're snoring
                                C                          D
But if you're bored then you're boring, the agony and the irony, they're killing me...woah
