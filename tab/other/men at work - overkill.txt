CAPO II
 
D                A     C                 G
  I can't get to sleep, I think about the implications
D                  A   C                G
  Of diving in too deep and possibly the complications
D               A     C            G
  Especially at night, I worry over situations
D                  A     C                   G
  I know will be alright, perhaps its just my imagination

Bm                     A
  Day after day it reappears
Bm                              A
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
F#                    G       A
Ghost appear and fade away


D                A     C                 G
  Alone between the sheets only brings exasperation
D                A     C                 G
  It's time to walk the streets, smell the... desperation
D                A     C                 G
  At least there's pretty lights and though there's little variation
D                A     C                 G
  It nullifies the night from Overkill

  Day after day it reappears
Bm                              A
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
F#                    G       A
Ghost appear and fade away, come back another day

Of diving in too deep, and possibly the complications
D                A     C                 G
Especially at night, I worry over situations now
D                A     C                 G
I know will be alright, it's just Overkill
