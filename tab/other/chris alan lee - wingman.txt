  This chick's rockin' your bro on the dance floor
Dsus2                 G
  But she's towing an anchor
D            G
  A junior investment banker
Bm                       A                 F#
  Who's talking about herself and not much more, ooh
G              D                            A
  So buy her a beer, it's the reason you're here, mighty wingman
Bm              D           A            Bm        A        G
  You're taking one for the team so your buddy can live the dream
F#     G    D   
  Wingmaaan
