Tonight all started as a double date, an excuse to ignore the heat
G                Bm                Em                    C
On the ride back to her place, her eyes sparkled with connection
G       Bm                    Em
  but I knew I wasn't getting nothing
      G        Em                           Am           C
There goes the parking brake again. It's my last shot at rejection
G                Em                Am                          C
So I tried for a kiss to no avail, but at least I got what I expected

G
She just looked and said “honestly, you thought that you could get with me?”
                                              C
I shrugged it off and let my eyes roll to the floor
G
I'll find my own way to the door, this is your last cue to get out of here
                                    C
That didn't hurt cause I didn't try hard

G Bm        Em                C    G  Bm              Em
     With a beer bottle in my hand, I tried to hail a cab
G             Bm     Em      C       G          Bm           Em
The man said “jump in my old friend”. And I was headed home again

           G                 Em
The driver waits for a while, he said with a smile
    Am                            C
I remember last time I came to St Paul
  G              Em                 Am
I picked up some drunken wrecks who needed all one day tests
                                         C
to check if they got burned by backstage sex

    G
The whole band rode on one girl who left out a small detail
                                       C
that she got dosed and they were gonna burn like hell
G
I paid the man and stepped outside into the downpour until he left me
                                   C
I meant to ask if the car had been sterilized

      G             Em                      Am           C
Cause those are the things most bothersome. Hot days and wet nights following
G                     Em     Am                 C
Who was that girl backstage? Is it the one that just denied me
      G     Em          Am     C
God I hope so. Oh god I hope so
      G      Em Am C G
God I hope so
