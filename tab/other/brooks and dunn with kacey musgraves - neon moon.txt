          C                C
When the sun goes down, on my side of town
        C                   C
That lonesome feeling comes to my door
         F                  C
And the whole world, turns blue
                C                      C
And there's a rundown bar across the railroad tracks
         C              C
I got a table for two, way in the back
      F                            C
Where I sit alone, and I think of losing you
              G              G                    C
I spend most every night, beneath the light of a neon moon

        F                 G
If you lose your one and only
                F                  G
There's always room here for the lonely
               F                         G
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
      C
Of a neon moon
 
                C                     C
I think of two young lovers, runnin' wild and free
  C                   C
Close my eyes, and sometimes see
  F                          C
You in the shadows, of this smoke filled room
           C                     C
No tellin' how many tears, I've sat here and cried
     C              C
Or how many lies, that I've lied
        F                          C
Tellin' my poor heart, he'll come back some day
             G              G                             C
Oh, but I'll be alright, as long as there's light from a neon moon
 
        F                 G
If you lose your one and only
                F                  G
There's always room here for the lonely
               F                         G
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
      C
Of a neon moon

F       G
Oooh, ooooh
F       G
F       G      C
Oooh, ooooh
F       G
Oooh, ooooh
F       G
F       G      C
Oooh, ooooh

          C                C
The jukebox plays on, drink by drink
        C                               C
And the words to every sad song seem to say what I think
         F                                 C
And this pain inside of me, it ain't ever gonna end
              G              G                           C
Oh, but I'll be alright, as long as there's light from a neon moon
 
            F                 G
Oh, if you lose your one and only
                F                  G
There's always room here for the lonely
               F                         G
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
      C
Of a neon moon
            F                 G
Oh, if you lose your one and only
                F                  G
There's always room here for the lonely
               F                         G
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
      C
Of a neon moon

            F                 G
Oh, if you lose your one and only
                F                  G
There's always room here for the lonely
               F                         G
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
      C
Of a neon moon
