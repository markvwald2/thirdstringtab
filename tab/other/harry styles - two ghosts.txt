E  F#m11  G#m6  F#m11    2x

E                              F#m11
Same lips red, same eyes blue, same white shirt, couple more tattoos
G#m6                               F#m11
     But it's not you and it's not me
E                               F#m11
Tastes so sweet, looks so real, sounds like something that I used to feel
G#m6                          F#m11
     But I can't touch what I see
 
      A                  E         A                  E
We're not who we used to be, we're not who we used to be
           C#m        B               A        G#m6      F#m11
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
C#m       B               A                    E     F#m11  G#m6  F#m11
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
 
E                                        F#m11
The fridge light washes this room white, moon dances over your good side
G#m6                        F#m11
    This was all we used to need
E                                   F#m11
Tongue-tied like we've never known, telling those stories we already told
G#m6                                   F#m11
    'Cause we don't say what we really mean
 
      A                  E         A                  E
We're not who we used to be, we're not who we used to be
           C#m        B               A        G#m6      F#m11
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
      A                  E         A                  E
We're not who we used to be, we're not who we used to be
           C#m        B             A          G#m6  F#m11
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
C#m       B               A                    E
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

I'm just trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
