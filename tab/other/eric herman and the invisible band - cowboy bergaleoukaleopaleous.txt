   Em                         D
He wore a purple mask, orange pants and mint green boots
    Em                             D
His hat was big, his mustache even bigger
    Bm                                   F#m
The sheriff from that Old West town sure looked like quite a hoot
        E7                               A             A7
But his eye was sharp, his finger always ready on that trigger

A7              A#dim                Bm7            E7
Why his name is not well-known? It's hard to say, I guess

Cowboy Bergaleoukaleopaleous, the greatest man who ever wore a badge out in the West
   D           D7          G              Gm
He had a lousy name, so he never got much fame

People said "Oh who was that masked man? - Oh that was cowboy Bergaly... Burgaly.. Errr... That was the Lone Ranger"

D                                  A7                            D
Others got more credit, but Cowboy Bergaleoukaleopaleous was the best

Em                          D
Riding on a train bound for Reno
    Em                           D
Two outlaws came on and tried to make off with the gold
    Bm                             F#m
But when the sheriff opened up the bathroom door
   E7                            A7
He knocked both them outlaws out cold

D                   A             A7                           D
Cowboy Bergaleoukaleopaleous, the greatest man who ever shot a can out of the sky
   D           D7          G              Gm
He had a lousy name, so he never got much fame

Folks said "Who was that fine chieftain? - Oh, that was cowboy Burdgelo... Balaby... Errr Err... Buffalo Bill"

D                                 A7                            D
Others got the credit, but Cowboy Bergaleoukaleopaleous was the guy

And he could sing too
G             D              A              D
(yodeling)  Yee-haw!   (yodeling)  Yee-haw!
G            D               A7
(yodeling)  Yee-haw!

Can we buy his album, mama? Yes, dear, but I don't know his name. - Oh, that's cowboy errrr... errr...Roy Rogers, ma'am that's Roy Rogers

     Em                          D
They say he had a horse he named Horsie
    Em                           D
And he could ride her clear over wide ravines
Bm                                F#m
When they asked him how she could jump so far
   E7                               A7
He said he fed her nothing else but campfire beans

D                   A             A7                             D
Cowboy Bergaleoukaleopaleous, the greatest man who ever shoveled hay out of a stall
   D           D7          G              Gm
He had a lousy name, so he never got much fame

"Who was that great rider? â€“ Oh that was cowboy Burgely... Ergely... Errr that was Annie Oakley... what a mighty handsome woman! She needs a shave!"

D                                  A7                           D
Others got more credit, but Cowboy Bergaleoukaleopaleous did it all

    Em                         D
The legend says he died age of ninety
   Em                         D
by chokin' on a twig he had between his teeth
          D                 D7
It took a ten foot stone to fit his name
       G                         Gm
at the place where they laid his bones
          D
It read, "Here lies the greatest cowboy that ever lived--
A7                    D
Bergaleoukaleopaleous Jones"
