F                                   Bb  
  Many times I've tried to tell you, many times I've cried alone  
F                                   Bb  
  Always I'm surprised how well you cut my feelings to the bone
Gm                             F              Bb               
  Don't wanna leave you really, I've invested too much time                                 
Gm                        C        
  To give you up that easy to the doubts that complicate your mind                               

F                  Bb                      C  
  We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder 
       F                        Bb                      C
  We belong to the sound of the words we've both fallen under
      F                 Bb                      C  
  Whatever we deny or embrace, for worse or for better
C7   F          Bb                C  
We belong, we belong, we belong together

F                              Bb
  Maybe it's a sign of weakness when I don't know what to say
F                                    Bb                            
  Maybe I just wouldn't know what to do with my strength anyway
Gm                       F         Bb                     
  Have we become a habit? Do we distort the facts                                 
Gm                               C  
  Now there's no looking forward, now there's no turning back when you say                             
  
F                  Bb                      C  
  We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder

  Whatever we deny or embrace, for worse or for better
C7   F          Bb                C  
We belong, we belong, we belong together

  Close your eyes and try to sleep now, close your eyes and try to dream
F                                     Bb                           
  Clear your mind and do your best to try and wash the palette clean
Gm                          F            Bb                  
  We can't begin to know it, how much we really care
Gm                            C
  I hear your voice inside me, I see your face everywhere, still you say                            
  
F                  Bb                      C

We belong, we belong, we belong together
