A           D   F# E A           D    F#    E
Hey smilin' strange, you lookin' happily deranged
A                 D         F#   E
Can you settle to shoot me? (Lost lyric)
   A        D           F#     E
Or have you picked your target yet?

Hey Sandy (Ay ay ay)

Don't you talk back (Ay ay ay) Hey Sandy
 
A            D   F#  E
 Four feet away,
A      D             F#         E
End of speech is the end of the day
A            D      F#    E
We was only funnin'
    A     D                F#      E
But guiltily I thought you had it comin'
