I'm not knocking your want to carry that home
Amaj7    E             B7                    F#m
Took it with you when you moved and got it broke
Amaj7      E          B7              F#m
Found the pieces, we counted them all alone
Amaj7  E           B7             F#m
Didn't add up, forgot to carry a zero

I can't be your apologist very long 
Amaj7    E                B7             F#m
I'm surprised that you'd want to carry that on 
Amaj7        E            B7                  F#m
Count your blemishes you can't they're all gone
Amaj7    E           B7                     F#m
I can't see your response putting them back on 
              Amaj7            E                 B7            F#m
Like they're waiting for your guard to fall so they can see it all 
              Amaj7              E                 B7            F#m
And you're so occupied with what other persons are occupied with and vice versa
  
     Amaj7       E                      B7                      F#m
And you've become what you thought was dumb, a fraction of the sum
               Amaj7                 E                       B7                       F#m
Yeah you've become, yeah you have become, a fraction of the sum, the middle and the front
 
              Amaj7                       E
And now it's coming back hasn't come too far 
        Amaj7                                  E
I was trying to help but I guess I pushed too hard 
            Amaj7                                  E (8th notes)
And now we can't even touch it 'fraid it'll fall apart
