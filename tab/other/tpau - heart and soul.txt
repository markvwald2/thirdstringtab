SPOKEN:
C                                              F
Something in the moonlight catches my eye, the shadow of a lover goes dancing by
C                                            F
Looking for a little bit of love to grow, so give me love, give me heart and soul
Bb                            F                   C
You never let me cross to the other side now, I'm tied to the hope that you will somehow
Bb                   F                     C
Hard on the heels of something more, but I lost your love, heart and soul

SPOKEN:                                              SUNG:
C                                                    C               F
The tear in my heart as you walk on by                  More than an ocean
  F
I feel so low and your head is high
C                                                    C
Everything you do convinces me more
F                                                               F
Please give me love, give me heart and soul           Keeps us apart
Bb                        F                          Bb        F
Looking to the day when I saw your face               I feel a tearing
C                                                                  C
Wasn't in the running, I wasn't in the race          in half of my heart
    Bb                      F
You moved in a way that I'd known before
      C
Now I want your love, heart and soul

C                                                    C
Tired eyes, tears that dried                           Leaving you ain't easy now
F                                                    F
on the bed on the pillow where you told your lies      but loving you's the harder part
C                                                    C
A turn of the key, my blood runs cold                  You never want me for myself
F                                                    F
Don't look back to hurt me more                        And I've needed you right from the
G                                                    G
Everything you said was to the point                 very start
F                                                       F
Oh won't you even try toâ€¦                            Oh won't you even try to...

C                                   Bb                    F
Give a little bit of heart and soul. Give a little bit of love to grow
C                                       Bb                F
Give a little bit of heart and soul and don't you make me beg for more
Bb                                                   C
Give a sign I need to know a little bit of heart and soul

C                                                   C               F
Walking on the water, walking on the air              A walk on the water, ooh
F
That was the heart of the love we shared
C                                                   C               F
Do you keep a secret left untold                      Is all that I need
       F
So you can't give love heart and soul?
  Bb                            F                   Bb        F                     C
I used to have a lover with the midas touch           But miracles are not happening
  C
I turned to gold but he turned to dust
Bb                     F
Left me for another, I turned to stone
    C
Now give me love, heart and soul

C                                                   C
Tired eyes, tears that dried                          Living in a fantasy
       F                                            F
On the bed on the pillow where you told your lies     There's never any room to breathe
  C                                                 C
A turn of the key, my blood runs cold                  Hoping every waking hour
F                                                   F
Don't look back to hurt me more                       You'll turn around and say that
G                                                   G
Everything you did just said it all                 we can start
F                                                      F
Can't you try to...                                 Oh won't you even try to...

C                                   Bb                    F
Give a little bit of heart and soul. Give a little bit of love to grow
C                                       Bb                F
Give a little bit of heart and soul and don't you make me beg for more
Bb                                                   C
Give a sign I need to know a little bit of heart and soul

Am  G    Am     F                 C             G
Somehow, I lost my way looking to see something in your eyes
    Bb              F               G
but love will never compromise. Now this is the politics of life, yeah

C                                   Bb                    F
Give a little bit of heart and soul. Give a little bit of love to grow

Give a little bit of heart and soul and don't you make me beg for more
Bb                                         C
Give a sign I need to know a little bit, a little bit
C                                   Bb                    F
Give a little bit of heart and soul. Give a little bit of love to grow
C                                       Bb                F
Give a little bit of heart and soul and don't you make me beg for more
Bb                                         C
Give a sign I need to know a little bit, a little bit
