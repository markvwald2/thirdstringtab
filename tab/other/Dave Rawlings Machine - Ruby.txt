A     C#m
Ruby, let down your golden hair
         D               Dm
When I'm standing at the bottom of your stairs
A     C#m
Ruby, I can see your TV on
        D                  Dm
But the people there, they flicker and they're gone


Bridge:
   D                                A
So let down your golden hair for me tonight
D                                   E
Let down your golden hair for me to climb


Chorus:
             A                  D
Just like an old-time telegraph man
A                                E
I came here with a simple job to do
            A
'Cause that news coming down the wire
D              Dm
Says that your head's on fire
        A                E          D       A
And I'm trying to get a message thr-ough to you


Ruby, you ain't lonely yet
With your crystal and your Russian cigarette
Ruby, haven't you heard before?
What good's finest tower when it hasn't got a door?
So let down your golden hair for me to climb
Let down your golden hair for me tonight
Just like an old-time telegraph man
I came here with a simple job to do
'Cause that news coming down the wire
Says that your bed's on fire
And I'm trying to get a message through to you

Ruby

I'm that old-time telegraph man
And I came here with a simple job to do
'Cause that news coming down the wire
Says that your world's on fire
And I'm trying to get a message through to you

I'm that old-time telegraph man
And I came here with a simple job to do
'Cause that news coming down the wire
Says that your world's on fire
And I'm trying to get a message through to you
