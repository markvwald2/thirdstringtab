G                     Dsus2   C
  Haven't been wasted in  a  long time
G                 Dsus2   C
  But tonight it feels   just fine
 C/B    Am                     Em                         D             (D)
Riding home with windows up, alone with a plastic cup of real good wine
 

           G                     Dsus2    C
When I get out of this hole I'm going to Tupelo
           G                                D
There's a girl out there that'll treat me fair
             G                      Dsus2      C        C/B
Get about a week of spring and the summer is blistering
      Am                 D                       Em
There ain't no one from here that'll follow me there
         C                  D                         G
No there ain't no one from here that will follow me there

G                           Dsus2   C
  She said there's nothin' left to talk about
G               Dsus2      C
  At my age I should have figured out
C/B         Am                                  Em                              D           (D)
    Which drawer to put the good knives in the wars between weekends tore our playhouse down
 

G                     Dsus2    C
  Kept her close but way too close to me
G                     Dsus2   C
  She never lived up to  my  memory
  C/B    Am                           Em                           D       (D)
Driving fast with the windows down a past I don't belong to now a mystery

When I get out of this hole I'm going to Tupelo

There's a girl out there that'll treat me fair
             G                      Dsus2      C        C/B
Get about a week of spring and the summer is blistering
         Am                 D                       Em
So there ain't no one from here that'll follow me there
         C                  D                         G
No there ain't no one from here that will follow me there

Well there ain't no one from here that will follow me there
