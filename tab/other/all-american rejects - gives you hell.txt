E  C#m  A    (2x)

  E             C#m     A                       E
I wake up every evening, with a big smile on my face
       C#m                A     
And it never feels out of place 
    E                     C#m    A            E       C#m                 A      riff 1
And you're still probably working at a 9 to 5 pace, I wonder how bad that tastes

                E                       C#m                     A
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
                 E                      C#m                     A     riff 1
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

    E                   C#m        A                       E        C#m                 A   riff 1
Now where's your picket fence love, and where's that shiny car, and did it ever get you far
       E             C#m        A                            E            C#m                 A
You've never seem so tense love, I've never seen you fall so hard, do you even know where you are
    B               C#m           B                 A7
And truth be told I miss you, and truth be told I'm lying

                E                       C#m                     A
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
                 E                      C#m                     A
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

              E                  C#m                 A
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
            E                    B                       A
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself, yeah where'd it all go wrong, the list goes on and on
    B               C#m           B                 A7
And truth be told I miss you, and truth be told I'm lying

                E                       C#m                     A

Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell

    C#m                    A
Now you'll never see, what you've done to me
        E                               G#
You can take back your memories they're no good to me
    C#m                           F#m
And here's all your lies, you can look me in the eyes
          A                      B
With that sad, sad look that you wear so well

                E                                               A
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

                   E                                    A
When you hear this song and sing along, oh you'll never tell
                C#m               B                       E

You can sing along I hope that it puts you through hell
