A  E  Bm  D  x4
                     A              E
"Show me, show me, show me how you do that trick
    Bm                   D
The one that makes me scream" she said
     A                  E
"The one that makes me laugh" she said
       Bm            D
And threw her arms around my neck
   A              E            Bm             D
"Show me how you do it and I promise you, I promise that
           A           E           Bm            D
I'll run away with you, I'll run away with you"
 
A  E  Bm  D  x4
 
  A               E
Spinning on that dizzy edge
   Bm                  D
I kissed her face and kissed her head
      A                 E
And dreamed of all the different ways
   Bm               D
I had to make her glow
   A             E              Bm                 D
"Why are you so far away?" she said "Why won't you ever know
             A            E             Bm             D
That I'm in love with you, that I'm in love with you"
 
F#m   G              F#m   G
You, soft and only   You, lost and lonely
F#m     G                D
You, strange as angels, dancing in the deepest oceans
                                           A   E                     Bm    D
Twisting in the water you're just like a dream, you're just like a dream

A  E  Bm  D  x3

 A                 E
Daylight licked me into shape
   Bm               D
I must have been asleep for days
     A               E
And moving lips to breathe her name
  Bm           D
I opened up my eyes
     A             E            Bm           D
And found myself alone, alone alone above a raging sea
       A             E                 Bm                D
That stole the only girl I loved and drowned her deep inside of me

F#m   G              F#m   G
You, soft and only   You, lost and lonely
F#m   G               D
You, just like heaven
