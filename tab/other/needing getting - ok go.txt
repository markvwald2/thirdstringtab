(intro riff)

           D                   A/C#               Bm                  G
I've been waiting for months, waiting for years, waiting for you to change
              D                               A
Aw, but there ain't much that's dumber, there ain't much that's dumber
      D                        G
Than pinning your hopes on a change in another

    D                A#      Bm                     G
And I, yeah I still need you, but what good's that gonna do?
D            A               G                  D
  Needing is one thing, and getting getting's another

So I've been sitting around, wasting my time, wondering what you've been doing
           D                        A
Aw, and it ain't real forgiving, it ain't real forgiving
 D                      G
Sitting here picturing someone else living

    D                A#      Bm                     G
And I, yeah I still need you, but what good's that gonna do?
D            A               G                  D

(intro riff 3)

B   G   D   A#   Em   Em   G   Gm   D   D   A#   A

(a capella)
I've been hoping for months, hoping for years, hoping I might forget
Aw, but it don't get much dumber, it don't get much dumber
Than trying to forget a girl when you love her

    D                A#      Bm                     G
And I, yeah I still need you, but what good's that gonna do?
D            A               G                  D
  Needing is one thing, and getting getting's another
