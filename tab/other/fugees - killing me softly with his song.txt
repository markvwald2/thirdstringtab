Em                         Am       D7                       G
Strumming my pain with his fingers, singing my life with his words
Em                     A                    D           C
Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly with his song
           G               C                     Esus4           E
Telling my whole life with his words, killing me softly with his song

(drums only)
Am7          D                  G           C
  I heard he sang the good song, I heard he had a style
Am7        D                   Em
  And so I came to see him and listen for a while
Am7            D7                G           B7
  And there he was this young boy, a stranger to my eyes

Em                         Am       D7                       G
Strumming my pain with his fingers, singing my life with his words
Em                     A                    D           C
Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly with his song
           G               C                     Esus4           E
Telling my whole life with his words, killing me softly with his song

Am7          D                  G            C
  I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd
Am7         D                    Em
  I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud
Am7             D7              G            B7
  I prayed that he would finish, but he just kept right on

Em                         Am       D7                       G
Strumming my pain with his fingers, singing my life with his words
Em                     A                    D           C
Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly with his song
           G               C                     Esus4           E
Telling my whole life with his words, killing me softly with his song

Em  Am  D7  G
Em  A  D  C
G  C  Esus4  E

Em                         Am       D7                       G
Strumming my pain with his fingers, singing my life with his words
Em                     A                    D           C
Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly with his song
           G               C                     Esus4           E
Telling my whole life with his words, killing me softly with his song


Em                   Am    D7                       G
Strumming my pain...       singing my life with his words
Em                     A                    D           C
Killing me softly with his song, killing me softly with his song
           G               C                     Esus4           E
Telling my whole life with his words, killing me softly with his song
