Capo I

A  G  C    x2

A          G                      C                 A
I saw her, yeah I saw her, with a black tongue tied round the roses
A                            G        C                A
A fist pounding on a vending machine, toy diamond ring stuck on her finger
A                                       G                          C
With a noose she could hang from the sun and point it out with the dark sunglasses
A                                   G                             C
Walking crooked down the beach, she spits in the sand where their bones are bleaching

E        G                        D 
   And I know I'm gonna steal her eye, she doesn't even know it's wrong
E          G                      D 
   And you know I'm gonna make it die, take her where her soul belongs
E    G                        F#m  F
   I know I'm gonna steal her eye, nothing that I wouldn't try

E  D            A     E  D            A
Hey my sun-eyed girl, hey my sun-eyed girl
E  D             A    E   D            A
     My sun-eyed girl, hey my sun-eyed girl
 
A          G                        C                    A
I saw her, yeah I saw her, with her hands tied back, her rags are burnin'
A                       G            C                   A
Calling out from a land-filled life, scrawling her name upon the ceiling
A                                    G                 C
Throw a coin in the fountain of dust, white noise, her ears are ringing
A                                    G                      C
Got a ticket for my midnight hanging, throw a bullet from a freight train leaving

E        G                        D 
   And I know I'm gonna steal her eye, she doesn't even know it's wrong
E          G                      D 
   And you know I'm gonna make it die, take her where her soul belongs
E    G                        F#m  F
   I know I'm gonna steal her eye, nothing that I wouldn't try

E  D            A     E  D            A
Hey my sun-eyed girl, hey my sun-eyed girl
E  D             A    E   D            A
     My sun-eyed girl, hey my sun-eyed girl
