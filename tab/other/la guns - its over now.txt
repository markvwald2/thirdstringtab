Just another night and I'm all alone
E     Asus2            E               Asus2
And I wonder where you are, who you're holding

E       Asus2       E    Asus2
And I'm wasting time by the telephone
E  Asus2        E      Asus2
It's harder when there's no way of knowing

A                   B
I thought we'd be together some day
A                            B
There was nothing that could keep me away
F#m                      A                  E  Asus2  E  Asus2
Coulda worked it out somehow, but it's over now
F#m                      A                    E  Asus2  E  Asus2
Thought you'd be comin' 'round, but it's over now

E      Asus2         E      Asus2
When I close my eyes, I can see your face
E         Asus2    E          Asus2
There was still so much to discover
E       Asus2          E      Asus2
All the time we shared, can't be erased
E  Asus2             E        Asus2
   Now you're in the arms of another

A                     B
I always thought we'd make it some day
A                            B
There was nothing that could keep me away
F#m                      A                  E  Asus2  E  Asus2

F#m                        A                    E  Asus2  E  Asus2
I thought you'd be comin' 'round, but it's over now

C#m                   G#m
If you broke my heart, I can't let it show
A                      B
I can take the pain, I can't let you go
C#m                G#m
Some people change, I guess it had to be
A                            B
Even though you're gone now, you still mean so much to me

Just another day, I'm still holdin' on
E               Asus2  E                Asus2
No matter how I try, I can't shake this feeling
E        Asus2       E     Asus2
Yeah I'm sitting here like nothing's wrong
E         Asus2           E        Asus2
I'm still lookin' for someone to believe in

A                          B
I thought we'd be together someday
A                            B
