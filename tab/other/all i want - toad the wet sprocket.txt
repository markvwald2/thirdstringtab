Dm        F        C        Am7
Nothing so loud as hearing when we lie
Dm        F        C        Am7
Truth is not kind, and you've said neither am I
Dm        F        C        Am7        F        Am7        Bbsus2
And the air outside so soft is saying everythiiiiiing… everything

(All I want is to feel this way) to be this close, to feel the same

Dm        F        C        Am7
Nothing's so cold as closing the heart when all we need

Dm        F        C        Am7        F        Am7        Bbsus2
And the air outside so soft, confessing everythiiiiiing… everything

G        Am7        G        F        C        G        F
And it won't matter now, whatever happens will be
C        G        D        F
Though the air speaks of all we'll never be, it won't trouble me
