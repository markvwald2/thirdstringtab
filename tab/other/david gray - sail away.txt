  Sail away with me honey, I put my heart in your hands
Am                        F    Dm
  Sail away with me honey now, now, now
Am      C           F          Dm         F                     G7   Dm

C                  Em           Am                          G

C                    Em           C                       Em

C                       Em          Am                      G
  Little darling if you hear me now, never needed you so bad
F                          Dm

  Sail away with me, what will be will be, I wanna hold you now, now, now

C                           Em        C                          Em 
  I've been talking drunken gibberish, fallin' in and out of bars
C                         Em         Am                          G
  Trying to get some explanation here for the way some people are
F                             Dm (break)

  Your break me up if you pull me down, whoa
Am      C           F          Dm         F                     G7   Dm
