Bm                     G                   Em                        G/A                A#m6
Any other day I would call, you would say baby, how's your day? But today it ain't the same
Bm                      G                Em                               G/A                A#m6
Every other word is Uh-huh, yeah, okay, could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
Bm                             G               Em                         G/A          A#m6
If you took it there, first of all, let me say I am not the one to sit around and be played
Bm                                  G                        Em                                G/A              A#m6
So prove yourself to me if I'm the girl that you claim, why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?

   Bm                                      G                   
I know you say that I am assuming things, something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
  Em                                                  G/A                  A#m6
Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange, if nobody's holdin' you back from me
       Bm                                   G                   
'Cause I know how you usually do, when you sayin' everything to me times two
  Em                                   G/A                    A#m6
Why can't you just tell the truth? If somebody's there, then tell me who

Bm                   G                   Em                      G/A          A#m6
Say my name, say my name, if no one is around you, say, Baby, I love you, if you ain't runnin'
Bm                          G                         Em                     G/A    A#m6

What is up with this? Tell the truth, who you with? How would you like it if I came over with my clique?
        Bm                       G                       Em                          G/A             A#m6
Don't try to change it now, say you gotta bounce, when two seconds ago you said you just got in the house
      Bm                             G               Em                         G/A          A#m6
It's hard to believe that you are at home by yourself, when I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else
Bm                                  G                        Em                                G/A              A#m6
Just this question, why do you feel you gotta lie? Gettin' caught up in your game, where you cannot say my name

   Bm                                      G                   
I know you say that I am assuming things, something's goin' down, that's the way it seems
  Em                                                  G/A                  A#m6
