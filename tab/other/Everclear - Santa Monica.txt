                              G5   Em7   G5
I am still living with your ghost
                    Em7     G5   Em7   G5   Em7   G5
Lonely and dreaming of the west coast
         G5      Em7     D5   E5   C5
I don't want to be your downtime
         A5               G5   Em7   G5   Em7   G5   Em7
I don't want to be your stupid game

                              G5   Em7   G5
With my big black boots and an old suitcase
                    Em7     G5   Em7   G5   Em7   G5
I do believe I'll find myself a new place
         G5      Em7     D5   E5   C5
I don't want to be the bad guy
         A5               G5   Em7   G5
I don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore
                Em7     D5   E5   C5
I just want to see some palm trees
         A5               G5   Em7   G5
Go and try to shake away this disease
 
                         C5
We can live beside the ocean
           D5     G5
Leave the fire behind
          E5        D5
Swim out past the breakers
           C5    G5
Watch the world die
                         C5
We can live beside the ocean
           D5     G5
Leave the fire behind
          E5        D5
Swim out past the breakers
           C5    G5
Watch the world die
 
                              G5   Em7   G5
I am still dreaming of your face
                    Em7     G5   Em7   G5   Em7   G5
Hungry and hollow for all the things you took away
         G5      Em7     D5   E5   C5
I don't want to be your good time
         A5               G5   Em7   G5   Em7   G5   Em7
I don't want to be your fall-back crutch anymore
 
                              G5   Em7   G5
I'll walk right out into a brand new day
                    Em7     G5   Em7   G5   Em7   G5
Insane and rising in my own weird way
         G5      Em7     D5   E5   C5
I don't want to be the bad guy
         A5               G5   Em7   G5
I don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore
                Em7     D5   E5   C5
I just want to feel some sunshine
         A5               G5   Em7   G5
I just want to find some place to be alone
 
                         C5
We can live beside the ocean
           D5     G5
Leave the fire behind
          E5        D5
Swim out past the breakers
           C5    G5
Watch the world die
                         C5
We can live beside the ocean
           D5     G5
Leave the fire behind
          E5        D5
Swim out past the breakers
           C5    G5
Watch the world die
