A man in my shoes runs the light and all the papers lie tonight
    C                       Fmaj7              
But falling over you is the news of the day
Fmaj7            Em7       Fmaj7          Em
Angels fall like rain, and love is all of heaven away
  G                       Fmaj7               G                       Fmaj7
Inside you time moves and she don't fade, the ghost in you, she don't fade

    C                                Fmaj7
The race is on I'm on your side, but hearing you my engines died
    C                           Fmaj7
I'm in the mood for you, or for running away
        Fmaj7              Em7     Fmaj7                   Em
All the stars come down in you but love, love, love, can't give it away

Inside you time moves and she don't fade, the ghost in you, she don't fade
  G                           Fmaj7                G                        Fmaj7
Inside you the time moves and she don't fade away, don't you know she don't fade

   C                                   Fmaj7
So don't you go, it makes no sense and all these talking supermen
     C                           Fmaj7
just take away the time, just to get it away
Fmaj7                  Em7         Fmaj7                                Em

Inside you time moves and she don't fade, the ghost in you, she don't fade away

Inside you time moves and she don't fade away, the ghost in you, she don't fade
