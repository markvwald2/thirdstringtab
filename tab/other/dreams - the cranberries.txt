  Oh, my life
                    B
Is changing everyday
                     E
In every possible way
           A
And oh, my dreams
                            B
It's never quite as it seems
                       E
Never quite as it seems

 I know I felt like this before
A                                B
 But now I'm feeling it even more
                        E
Because it came from you, then I open up and see
A                             B
 The person falling here is me
                     E
A different way to be
 
G          C
Aaah, laalaaaah
           G
La la laaaa
     C
Laalaaah
        E
Laah ah aaah
 
       A
I want more
                    B
Impossible to ignore
                    E
Impossible to ignore
                 A
And they'll come true
                    B
Impossible not to do
                    E
Impossible not to do
 
E
 And now I tell you openly
A                                  B
 You have my heart so don't hurt me
                           E
You're what I couldn't find
A totally amazing mind
A                            B
 So understanding and so kind
                       E
You're everything to me
 
E       A
 Oh, my life
                    B
Is changing everyday
                     E
In every possible way
           A
And oh, my dreams
                            B
It's never quite as it seems
                           E
'Cause you're a dream to me, dream to me
