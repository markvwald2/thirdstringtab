F#m   B   F#m   B   E


    E              E6
I know I stand in line until you
  E                 E6              F#m             B   F#m   B
think you have the time to spend an evening with me
    F#m            B                F#m                 B
And if we go someplace to dance I know that there's a chance
              E                E6   E   E6
you won't be leaving with me
    E7              E9          E7           E9
And afterwards we drop into a quiet little place
             A           C
And have a drink or two
 

     F#m            B              F#m               B
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid 
        E        E6   E   E6
like I love you
 

       E7            E9                E7                E9
I can see it in your eyes that you despise the same old lines 
               A           A/E   A   A/E
you heard the night before
      F#                C#m7            F#
And though it's just a line to you for me it's true
     C#m7            B
and never seemed so right before


    E            E6                E              E6
I practice everyday to find some clever lines to say 
             F#m              B   F#m   B
to make the meaning come true
      F#m              B             F#m           B
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late
          E            E6   E   E6
And I'm alone with you
     E7                  E9              E7                 E9
The time is right your perfume fills my head the stars get red 
            A             C
and oh the nights so blue
 

      F#m           B              F#m               B
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid
        E        E6  E  E6
like I love you
 

E  E6  E  E6  F#m  B  F#m  B
F#m  B  F#m  B  E  E6  E  E6
 

     E7                 E9               E7                 E9
The time is right your perfume fills my head the stars get red 
            A             C
and oh the nights so blue
 
      F#m           B              F#m               B
And then I go and spoil it all by saying something stupid
        E        C
like I love you
   E        C
I love you
   E
I love you
