    G                                     C        D
She stepped off the bus out into the city streets
       G                                               C               D
Just a small town girl with her whole life packed in a suitcase by her feet

    G                                                 C          D        G
But somehow the lights didn't shine as bright as they did on her mamas tv screen
     G                                         C
And the work seemed harder and the days seemed longer
         D                   Em
Than she ever thought they'd be

Em                                                 D
But you know you got to stick to your guns when it all comes down
      C                                     D               G
Cause sometimes you can't choose, it's like heads they win, tails you're gonna lose

G                            C         D
Win big, mamas fallen angel, lose big, living out her lies
G                                 C            D                      G
Wants it all, mamas fallen angel, lose it all, rollin the dice of her life

        G                                           C     D
Now she found herself in the fast lane livin day to day
           G                                           C            D
Turned her back on her best friends, yeah, and let her family slip away
G                                                 C
Just like a lost soul, caught up in the Hollywood scene
        D				     G
All the parties and the limousines
                                   C                 D                        Em
Such a good actress hiding all her pain, trading her memories for fortune and fame

Em                        D
Just a step away from the edge of a fall
C                               D                  G
Caught between heaven and hell, where's the girl I knew a year ago

Em                          D
Too much too soon or just a little too late
    C                            D                G
Cause when her ship came in, she wasn't there and it just wouldn't wait

G                            C         D
Win big, mamas fallen angel, lose big, living out her lies
G                                 C            D                      G
Wants it all, mamas fallen angel, lose it all, rollin the dice of her life
