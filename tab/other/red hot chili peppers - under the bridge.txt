Sometimes I feel like I don't have a part- ner
E        B        C#m        A
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
E        B        C#m        G#m        A
Is the city I live in the city of an- gels
E        B        C#m        A        Emaj7
Lonely as I am together we cry

I drive on her streets 'cause she's my compan- ion
E        B        C#m        A
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
E        B        C#m        G#m        A
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me win- dy
E        B        C#m        A        Emaj7
I never worry now that is a lie

It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
E        B        C#m        A
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
E        B        C#m        G#m        A
At least I have her love the city she loves me
