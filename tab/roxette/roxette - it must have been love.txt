      C                               F             G
Lay a whisper on my pillow, leave the winter on the ground
          C                      F              Dm               G
I wake up lonely, there's air of silence in the bedroom and all around
         Am              C               F    G
Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away

                  C                  F                      Dm          Am          G
It must have been love but it's over now, it must have been good, but I lost it somehow
                  C                  F                       Dm               Am           G
It must have been love but it's over now, from the moment we touched till the time had run out

       C                                F                 G
Make believing, we're together that I'm sheltered by your heart
           C                      F            Dm               G
But in and outside I've turned to water like a teardrop in your palm
           Am            C             F    G
And it's a hard winter's day, I dream away

                  C                  F                      Dm              Am         G
It must have been love but it's over now, it was all that I wanted, now I'm living without
                  C                  Gm                  C                           Bb
It must have been love but it's over now, it's where the water flows, it's where the wind blows
