Friday night I crashed your party, Saturday I said I'm sorry
                                E
Sunday came and trashed me out again
      Bm                      G
I was only having fun, wasn't hurting anyone
       E                             A
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change

          A
I've been stranded in the combat zone, I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
                               E
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
        Bm                          G
And you told me not to drive, but I made it home alive
       E                                A
So you said that only proves that I'm insane

           E               A
You may be right, I may be crazy
          E             D              F#m         A
Oh but it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
             E                   A
Turn out the light, don't try to save me
           D               E                    A
You may be wrong for all i know, but you may be right

Remember how I found you there, alone in your electric chair
                                 E
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
         Bm                        G
You were lonely for a man, I said "take me as I am"
           E                             A
'Cause you might enjoy some madness for awhile

    A
Now think of all the years you tried to find someone to satisfy you
                           E
I might be as crazy as you say
       Bm                              G
If I'm crazy then it's true, that it's all because of you
        E                          A
And you wouldn't want me any other way

           E               A
You may be right, I may be crazy
          E             D              F#m         A
Oh but it just may be a lunatic you're looking for
                 E                       A
It's too late to fight, it's too late to change me
           D               E                    A
You may be wrong for all i know, but you may be right
