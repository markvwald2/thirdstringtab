 
D Cadd9   G              Cadd9    G
I seem to recognize your face
D    Cadd9  G                 Cadd9   G
Haunting familiar, yet I cant seem to place it
D        Cadd9  G                    Cadd9      G
Cannot find the candle of thought to light your name
D    Cadd9    G                Cadd9   G
Lifetimes are catchin' up with me

 
C        A               C
All these changes taking place
  A                  C
I wish i’d seen the place
    A             Em
But no-one’s ever taken me
 
D          Cadd9         G     Cadd9 G
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
D          Cadd9         G     Cadd9 G
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
 
D Cadd9   G              Cadd9   G
I swear I recognise your breath
D    Cadd9     G                Cadd9  G
Memories, like fingerprints are slowly raising
D       Cadd9      G             Cadd9  G
Me, you wouldn't recall, for I'm not my former
D           Cadd9     G              Cadd9   G
It's hard when you're stuck upon the shelf
 
C            A               C
I changed by not changing at all
      A                C
Small town predicts my fate
   A                       Em
Perhaps that's what no one wants to see
 
D      Cadd9   G           Cadd9    G
I just want to scream, "hello!"
D  Cadd9     G                   Cadd9         G
My god, it's been so long, never dreamed you'd return
D       Cadd9    G       Cadd9  G
But now here you are and here I am
D          Cadd9         G    Cadd9   G
Hearts and thoughts they fade away
 
D          Cadd9         G     Cadd9 G
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
D          Cadd9         G     Cadd9 G
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away
D          Cadd9         G     Cadd9 G
Hearts and thoughts they fade, away
D          Cadd9         G     Cadd9 G
Hearts and thoughts they fade, fade away (3x fade out)
