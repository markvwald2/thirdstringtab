If you take me back, back to your place
       G         C              D
I'll try not to bother you, I promise
            G          C       G           C
Cause it's cold in here and I wish it was hot
     G                 C                D
The sink's broke it's leaking from the faucet
 
      Em              C          G             D
I'm fractured in the fall and I wanna go home
Em             C                      G
It takes two when it used to take one
Em             C                       G
It takes two when it used to take only one
 
         G             C         G         C
Well my money's no good when I'm up to no good
    G         C             D
No good ever comes from it honest
         G                C        G                  C
I got a really good heart, I just can't catch a break
          G                        C                D
If I could I'd treat you like you wanted me to, I promise
 
      Em              C          G             D
I'm fractured in the fall and I wanna go home

I'm fractured in the fall and I wanna go home
Em             C                      G
It takes two when it used to take one
Em             C                      G
It takes two when it used to take one
