Precious little thing with eyes that dance around without their clothes

   Am7                 Bm7                     Bm2                           D
So buy a pretty dress, wear it out tonight for anyone you think could out do me

        C                                                                 C        G
And I'm further North than South, if I could shut my mouth she'd probably like this

   Am7                 Bm7                     Bm2                                 D

Be my winding wheel

Well the children laugh and sing a song that ushers in her driving rain
C                                                                 C        G

Be my winding wheel
