Last time I was here it was raining, it ain't raining anymore

Streets were drowning and the water's laming, all the ruins washed ashore
      C#m                        G#m            A               E
Now I'm just looking through the rubble, try to find out who we were

Last time I was here you were waiting, you're not waiting anymore

The window's broke and the smoke's escaping, the books scattered across the floor
        C#m                                  G#m                   A              E
And the church bells are ringing through the sirens, your coat was full of bullet holes

So, may the wind blow, may the moonlight know your name
A                                                  B
So, let the needle pull the record ‘round 'til the walls cave in
        n/c
You and I we're out there dancing in the dirty rain

And your eyes were filled with terror like smoke from the gasoline
       C#m                  G#m                A              E
As the stars exploding with gunfire, I saw you smiling just before
