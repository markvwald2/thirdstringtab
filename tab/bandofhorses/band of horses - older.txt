Fmaj7     C x2


Fmaj7                             C
Climb the cliff, Tower over all
Fmaj7                              C   G
And falling water, falling waterfall
                Fmaj7
And after all my plans
                   C
They melt into the sand
                       Fmaj7                C
Yeah you will be there on my mind through all
                    F            G         Fmaj7  C
Don't want to understand why you never get older


Fmaj7 C x2


Fmaj7                              C
It's time to dry off tattered overalls
Fmaj7                             C   G
Impatient waiting, way to hide a fall
                Fmaj7
And after all my plans
                   C
They melt into the sand
                       Fmaj7                C
Yeah you will be there on my mind through all
                    Fmaj7            G      Fmaj7   C
Don't want to understand why you never get older
