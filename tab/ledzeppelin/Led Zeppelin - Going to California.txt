G
Spent my days with a woman unkind,
                                   D
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine.
G
Made up my mind to make a new start,
                                            D
Going to california with an aching in my heart.
G
Someone told me theres a girl out there
                                          D
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair.

G
Took my chances on a big jet plane,
                                               D
Never let them tell you that theyre all the same.
G
The sea was red and the sky was grey,
                                           D
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today.
    G
The mountains and the canyons started to tremble and shake
                                      D
As the children of the sun began to awake. (watch out)

Dm
Seems that the wrath of the gods
 
Got a punch on the nose and it started to flow;
                     A7
I think I might be sinking.
Dm
Throw me a line if I reach it in time
 
Ill meet you up there where the path
                  A7
Runs straight and high.

G
To find a queen without a king
                                          D
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings (la la la la la)
G
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
                                                     D
Tryin to find a woman whos never, never, never been born.
G
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams,
                                                   D
Telling myself its not as hard, hard, hard as it seems.
