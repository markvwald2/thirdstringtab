Em                           D   C
There's colors on the street
      Em           D   C
Red white and blue
         Em                 D   C
People shufflin' their feet
         Em                    D   C
People sleepin' in their shoes
           Em                  D     C
There's a warnin' sign on the road ahead
           Em                           D          C
There's a lot of people sayin' we'd be better off dead
       Em                   D       C
Don't feel like Satan but I am to them
       Em                 D     C
so I try to forget it anyway I can

         Em                 D   C
I see a woman in the night
        Em              D   C
With a baby in her hand
           Em               D   C
There's an old street light
        Em         D   C
Near a garbage can
         Em                          D             C
Now she puts the kid away and she's gone to get a hit
     Em                            D      C
She hates her life and what she's done to it
       Em                      D             C
That's one more kid that will never go to school
       Em                        D         C
Never get to fall in love never get to be cool
