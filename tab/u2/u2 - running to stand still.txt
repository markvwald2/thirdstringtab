  So she woke up, woke up from where she was lyin' still
       D                                     G
Said "I gotta do somethin' about where we're goin'"
D                       G
  Step on a steam train, step out of the driving rain maybe
D                              G
  Run from the darkness in the night

        A              C/G   G
Singing ah... ah-la-la-la-de-day
A          C/G   G          D          G
  Ah-la-la-la-de-day, ah-la-la-de-day

  Sweet the sin, bitter the taste in my mouth, I see seven towers, but I only see one way out
          D                                           G
You gotta cry without weeping, talk without speaking, scream without raising your voice
                    D                                     G
You know I took the poison from the poison stream, then I floated out of here

        A             C/G   G
Singing...   ah-la-la-la-de-day
A          C/G   G          D
  Ah-la-la-la-de-day, ah-la-la-de-day
 
  G        D       G
Ooooh... ooooh.. ooooh
 
D                                                    G
  She runs through the streets with eyes painted red, under a black belly of cloud in the rain
D                                      G
  In through a doorway, she brings me, white gold and pearls stolen from the sea
       D                           G
She is raging, she is raging and a storm blows up in her eyes
 
          A              C/G   G
She will...   suffer the needle chill
A                  C/G   G    D
  She's running to stand...   still
