A                C#m     F#m 
I hear the drums echoing tonight
    F#m/E      G                Bm       F#m  G    Bm 
She hears only whispers of some quiet conversation 
A            C#m               F#m 
She's coming in, twelve thirty flight
    F#m/E           G                    Bm                  F#m  G  Bm 
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation
A            C#m               F#m 
I stopped an old man along the way
F#m/E               G             Bm               F#m G   Bm 
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies 
A            C#m         F#m 
He turned to me as if to say
F#m/E           G                     Bm 
Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you

Em                  C               G        D 
  It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Em                       C              G               D 
  There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Em            C             G   D 
  I bless the rains down in Africa
Em                C              G               Bm  D  Em  D 
  Gonna take some time to do the things we never had...     ooh ooh

A             C#m            F#m 
The wild dogs cry out in the night
   F#m/E              G                Bm       F#m  G   Bm 
As they grow restless longing for some solitary company
A           C#m              F#m 
I know that I must do what's right
           F#m/E       G           Bm               F#m  G   Bm 
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
A         C#m                F#m 
I seek to cure what's deep inside
F#m/E              G                       Bm 
Frightened of this thing that I've become 

Em                  C               G        D 
  It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
Em                       C              G               D 
  There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
Em            C             G   D 
  I bless the rains down in Africa
Em                C              G               Bm  D  Em  D 
  Gonna take some time to do the things we never had...     ooh ooh
