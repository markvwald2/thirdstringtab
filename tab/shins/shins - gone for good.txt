E
Untie me, I've said no vows, the train is getting way too loud
        A                                  E
I gotta leave here my girl, get on with my lonely life
               B                                       E
Just leave the ring on the rail for the wheels to nullify

E
Until this turn in my head, I let you stay and you paid no rent
        A                         E
I spent twelve long months on the lam
              B                                             E
That's enough sitting on the fence for the fear of breaking dams

C#m        E                 A                    B
  I find a fatal flaw in the logic of love and go out of my head
C#m          E                     A
  You love a sinking stone that'll never elope
       B
So get used to the lonesome, girl you must atone some
                               A     E
Don't leave me no phone number there

E
It took me all of a year to put the poison pill to your ear
          A                          E
But now I stand on honest ground, on honest ground
            B                                  A
You want to fight for this love, but honey you cannot wrestle a dove
             E
So baby it's clear

C#m           E                       A
  You want to jump and dance, but you sat on your hands
         B
And lost your only chance
C#m          E                       A
  Go back to your hometown, get your feet on the ground
         B
And stop floating around
C#m        E                 A                    B
  I find a fatal flaw in the logic of love and go out of my head
C#m          E                     A
  You love a sinking stone that'll never elope
       B
So get used to the lonesome, girl you must atone some
                               A     E
Don't leave me no phone number there
