Am  Dm          E           Am             Dm

                     Dm     F    G                  A
what could have been easier, the picture is coming around now
                Dm          F   G                    A

how come i feel so washed up, the picture is coming around now
                   Dm    F   G                   Am
it could have been easier at such, such a tender age

Am  Dm        E           Am              Dm
I’m..... listening to the comforting sound
                E                  Am  Dm
of some kind of work being done outside
                    E                    Am
of sounds from next door the walls don’t hide
Am  Dm         E       Am               Dm       E                  Am  Dm
I’m...... listening to mountain to sound and the way it’s panned is cool
           E                Am  Dm                 E                        A  G

                   Dm          F   G                     A
how come she feels so washed up at such a, such a tender age now
                   Dm     F   G                           A
