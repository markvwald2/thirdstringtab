   Picture yourself in the living room, your pipe and slippers set out for you
                         Bm                 Em
I know you think that it ain't too far, but I...
                   C                            D      G
Hear the call of a lifetime ring, felt the need to get up for it
                   Am             Bm
Oh you cut out the middleman, get free from the middleman

  I want to forget how conviction fits, but can I get out from under it?
             Bm
Can I gut it out of me?
C                G                Am
 It can't all be wedding cake, it can't all be boiled away
                      Bm             B
I try but I can't let go of it, I can't let go of it

C                             G
 'Cause you don't talk to the water boy
C                              D             G
 and there's so much you could learn but you don't want to know,

  And it may not be photo op in the way that I spell it out

 But you won't hear from the messenger, don't wanna know 'bout something that you don't understand
