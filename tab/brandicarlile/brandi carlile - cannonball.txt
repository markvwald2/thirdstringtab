Capo II

      G           C               Bm          Em
I was born when I met you, now I'm dying to forget you
    Am      D      G D7
and that is what I know
         G               C             Bm            Em
Though I dreamed I would fall like a wounded cannonball
        Am           D        G  G7
sinking down with my heart in tow

Em                 Bm
Bright lights like white lightning
C           G     C          G
Who shot me down, who cut me down
Em         B7                 C          G
I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around
        C             D
How I'm lost, how I'm found

          G        C             Bm                 Em
There's a man all alone telling me his friends are gone
              Am       D     G D
that they've died and flown away
     G               C               Bm                Em
So I told him he was wrong, that your friends are never gone
       Am          D       G  G7
If you look to the sky and pray

Em                 Bm
Bright lights like white lightning
C           G     C          G
Who shot me down, who cut me down
Em         B7                 C          G
I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around
        C             D
How I'm lost, how I'm found
 
        G         C            Bm               Em
Someone told me a lie, someone looked me in the eye
         Am        D         G D
and said time will ease your pain
     G               C               Bm             Em
But behold, when you fall, its that same old cannonball
       Am            D     G  G7
coming back for your heart again

Em                 Bm
Bright lights like white lightning
C           G     C          G
Who shot me down, who cut me down
Em         B7                 C          G
I'm frozen in my bed till the day comes around
Em              Bm
And it may come around
         C          G
Till the day comes around
        Am            D
How I'm lost, how I'm found

      G           C               Bm          Em
I was born when I met you, now I'm dying to forget you
    Am      D      G
and that is what I know
