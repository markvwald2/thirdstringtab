G          D               Am       C
Come back now, even if you call me out
             G      D                   Am   C
You might be angry now of course you are
G           D                          Am      C
I'm scared too, didn't mean to take it out on you
          G      D                              Am      C
I know I always do, you're the strongest person in the room

Em         Bm   C             G/B        D/A
Turn back time, help me to rewind and we can
Em       Bm      D     D7/C
Find ourselves again

              G
It's not too late
  G7    C              B7               Em
Either way, I lose you in these silent days
          G
It wasn't right
           D     D7/C G
But it was right on   time

G           D
Don't look down
                        Am            C
I can feel it when your heart starts pounding
        G            D                  Am   C
It's beyond your control, you know it is
     G                          D               Em
It's getting to the point where I can't carry on
                C
I never held my breath for quite this
    G                       D                   Em  Cmaj7
And I don't take it back, I did what I had to do
   (long)

     C        G
It's not too late
G7      C              B7               Em
Either way, I lose you in these silent days
