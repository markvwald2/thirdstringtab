All of these lines across my face tell you the story of who I am
        F#m                                  D
So many stories of where I've been and how I got to where I am
          A                  E                     F#m           D
But these stories don't mean anything, when you've got no one to tell them to
     A     E              A  Asus4  A
It's true, I was made for you

           A                                  E
I climbed across the mountain tops, swam all across the ocean blue
                  F#m                                         D
I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules, but baby I broke them all for you
            A           E                   F#m                 D                  A
Oh, because even when I was flat broke, you made me feel like a million bucks, you do
E              A  Asus4 A
I was made for you

(A)                                                   E
You see the smile that's on my mouth, it's hiding the words that don't come out
           F#m                                            D
All of our friends who think that I'm blessed, they don't know my head's a mess
   A                   E                F#m                  D                      A
No they don't know who I really am, and they don't know what I've been through like you do
    E              A  Asus4  A
And I was made for you

             A                                 E
All of these lines across my face tell you the story of who I am

Oh, but these stories don't mean anything when you've got no one to tell them to
     A     E              A  Asus4  A
It's true, I was made for you
                   A         E              A  Asus4  A
Oh yeah, well it's true that I was made for you
