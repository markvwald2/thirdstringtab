D                          G              Em                    A
There will be droughts and days inundated, unveilings free from saturation
Bm                     G               D                            G
departures raised with no masquerading, there will be teachers that die by their own hand
Em                    A                  Bm                       G
pundits that push headlong for atonement, friends and followers devoted to living
D                           G                    Em                        A
There will be watchers that plot from in confines and those committed to society's circles
Em                  A                        Bm                           G
unwary cogs with no cadence or virtue, there will be right, there will be wrong

G           G/F#    G/E  D       A
Drop of the hat and it's already started
G         G/F#     G/E A
Just like that and the deed is done
G        G/F#     G/E D         A
What I'd give for the hat to be medicine
G        G/F#  G/E D            A
The time is... now to be on the run

D                   G                 Em            A
There will be machinations unforeseen, sleepwalking sense from a bad dream
Bm           G                   D                         G
No promenade walk in the parkway, there will be catchwords filled with infection
Em           A                Bm                 G
Circulars to prop up occasion, no golden mean to guide the footsteps
D                       G                        Em                        A
There will be levels on high hills that appraise, there will be unchanging certainties
Em              A                          Bm                           G
Barometers that follow the stampede, there will be right, there will be wrong

G           G/F#    G/E  D       A
Drop of the hat and it's already started
G         G/F#     G/E A
Just like that and the deed is done
G        G/F#     G/E D         A
What I'd give for the hat to be medicine
G        G/F#  G/E D            A
The time is... now to be on the run

D                          G          Em            A
There will be signposts of indication, semaphore go signs and warnings
Bm                  G                      D                           G
Hailstone halos and country-blues wailings, there will be strains that break out of straight time
Em                           A                       Bm                   G
To pave with grace different roads to the same place, no consequence to repay what's been given
D                       G               Em                A
There will be layers of means to an end, drawn-out days before resolution
Em                        A                     Bm                           G
Dregs will rain down from all directions, there will be right, there will be wrong

G           G/F#    G/E  D       A
Drop of the hat and it's already started
G         G/F#     G/E A
Just like that and the deed is done
G        G/F#     G/E D         A
What I'd give for the hat to be medicine
G        G/F#  G/E D            A
