Am  F  F  G  x2

Am        F              G
I feel a hunger, it's a hunger
Am             F                   G
that tries to keep a man awake at night
Am          F                    G
Are you the answer? I shouldn't wonder
Am      F                   G
When I feel you wet my appetite
Am            F              G
With all the power you're releasing
Am        F                       G
It isn't safe to walk the city streets alone
Am     F                  G
Anticipation's running through me
Am              F                       G
Let's find the key and turn this engine on
F                                                          G   F   G
I can feel you breathe, I can feel your heart beat faster

C        G      Am   F
Take me home tonight, I don't want to
C        G           Am      F
Let you go till you see the light
C        G      Am     F
Take me home tonight, listen honey just like Ronnie sang: “Be my little baby”
 
Am  F  F  G  x2

Am      F                     G
I get frightened in all this darkness
Am     F             G
I get nightmares, I hate to sleep alone
Am           F                  G
I need some company, a guardian angel
Am          F                         G
To keep me warm when the cold winds blow
F                                                          G   F   G
I can feel you breathe, I can feel your heart beat faster

C        G      Am   F
Take me home tonight, I don't want to
C        G           Am      F
Let you go till you see the light
C        G      Am     F                                                      Am  F  F  G
Take me home tonight, listen honey just like Ronnie sang: “Be my little baby”

              Am   G
Be my little baby
F                         Em   Dm               F
Just like Ronnie sang, I said just like Ronnie sang
G             N/C
Be my little baby, baby my darling, oh oh oh oh oh
Am                                F
I feel your hunger, it's a hunger

C        G      Am   F
Take me home tonight, I don't want to
C        G           Am      F
Let you go till you see the light
C        G      Am     F
Take me home tonight, listen honey just like Ronnie sang: “Be my little baby”
 
C        G      Am   F
Take me home tonight, I don't want to
C        G           Am      F
Let you go till you see the light
C        G      Am     F
Take me home tonight, listen honey just like Ronnie sang: “Be my little baby”
