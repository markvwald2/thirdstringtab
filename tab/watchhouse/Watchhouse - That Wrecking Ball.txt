I've taken to leaning, these past few days
         G                C
a little too heavy on my walking cane
Em                        G
cause I'm afraid shes's swinging my way
 C
that wrecking ball.

Now with all my ducks in a row
  G            C
with one pull I could let 'em go
Em          G
not to lose, just to show I 
C
could catch them all.

But every man bears a burden, his own beast by the horns
         G                            c
that he hides from the world when he's young and strong
       Em                         G
looking over his shoulder, half tethered and torn,
    C
still standing tall.
 
C                               D/F#
But every year rolls on like a runaway train
      G                             C
every beast grows stronger as the pendulum swings
  Em                G
to and fro, and on she goes
C
that wrecking ball.

I've just seen that rock of ages
           G               C
I've just held my saviors hands
    Em                          G
we danced on the water with my head on her shoulder
     C
she swore to never let me fall.

And wouldn't time seem so kindly
 G               C
if every bright eyed girl could be
 Em                 G
more like you and shelter me
            C           Am
from that wrecking ball
              D
that wrecking ball
